# Google Earth Engine Scripts

This folder contains all Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript scripts used for analyzing **urban built-up area expansion and growth rates** using the **GHSL (Global Human Settlement Layer) built-up surface dataset (P2023A)**.

The scripts are designed to be run in the **Google Earth Engine Code Editor**.

## 📂 Contents

### `ghsl_urban_growth.js`

Main analysis script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Loads the GHSL built-up surface dataset**
   - Dataset: `JRC/GHSL/P2023A/GHS_BUILT_S`
   - Spatial resolution: 100 m
   - Temporal coverage: 1975–2030

2. **Defines Area of Interest (AOI)**
   - Uses a user-drawn or imported `geometry`
   - Exports AOI as GeoJSON for documentation and reuse

3. **Visualizes built-up surfaces**
   - Displays built-up area layers on the map
   - Creates a multi-year built-up stack

4. **Calculates built-up area**
   - Computes total built-up area (sq. km) for each epoch
   - Example outputs for 1975 and 2020

5. **Time-series analysis**
   - Generates a built-up area time-series chart
   - Calculates year-to-year growth rate (%)

6. **Exports tabular results**
   - Single CSV containing:
     - `year`
     - `builtup_sqkm`
     - `growth_rate_percent`

7. **Exports map figures**
   - Built-up maps for selected years
   - Built-up stack visualization
   - AOI boundary map
   - Built-up change map (1975–2020)

## ▶ How to Run the Script

1. Open **https://code.earthengine.google.com/**
2. Create a new script
3. Copy the contents of `ghsl_urban_growth.js`
4. Define or import your **AOI geometry**
5. Click **Run**
6. Start exports from the **Tasks** tab

---

## 📤 Output Products

The script generates the following outputs:

### Tables (CSV)
- Built-up area and growth rate per year

### Raster Images (GeoTIFF / PNG)
- Built-up maps for 1975 and 2020
- Built-up stack (all years)
- Built-up change map (1975–2020)
- AOI boundary map

---

## ⚠ Notes & Best Practices

- All area values are calculated in **square kilometers (sq. km)**
- Growth rate is computed as **percentage change between consecutive epochs**
- The first year has `null` growth rate by definition
- Do **not** use `getInfo()` in exports to ensure server-side execution
