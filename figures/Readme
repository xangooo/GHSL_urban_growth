# Figures

This folder contains map figures exported from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** for visualizing urban built-up dynamics derived from the **GHSL Built-up Surface** dataset.

All images are exported as **PNG files** from the GEE map panel and are intended for use in documentation, reports, and publications.

## 🗺️ Figure Descriptions

### 1️⃣ `builtup_1975.png`
**Built-up area in 1975**

- Dataset: GHSL Built-up Surface
- Visualization:
  - Color palette: `#efefef` (non-built) → `#a29f01` (built-up)
  - Represents spatial extent of built-up land in 1975
- Purpose:
  - Baseline urban footprint
  - Historical comparison

---

### 2️⃣ `builtup_2020.png`
**Built-up area in 2020**

- Dataset: GHSL Built-up Surface
- Visualization:
  - Color palette: `#efefef` (non-built) → `#a29f01` (built-up)
- Purpose:
  - Current urban extent
  - Comparison with historical built-up patterns

---

### 3️⃣ `builtup_change_1975_2020.png`
**Built-up change map (2020 – 1975)**

- Derived by subtracting 1975 built-up from 2020 built-up
- Visualization:
  - Displayed using **opacity (gamma) settings**
  - No discrete color palette applied
- Interpretation:
  - Brighter areas indicate higher intensity of built-up expansion
  - Darker areas indicate little or no change
- Purpose:
  - Visualizing spatial patterns of urban growth

---

### 4️⃣ `aoi_boundary.png`
**Area of Interest (AOI) boundary**

- Represents the spatial extent used for analysis
- Exported as a painted boundary from GEE
- Purpose:
  - Reference map
  - Spatial context for all built-up figures

---

## 📝 Notes
