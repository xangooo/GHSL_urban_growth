## Data

The `data/` directory contains small example datasets for demonstration and validation purposes:

- `ghsl_builtup_area_and_growth_example.csv`: Example output CSV generated by the Earth Engine script.
- `aoi.geojson`: Example area of interest used in the analysis.

Large raster outputs (e.g., GeoTIFF stacks) are not included and can be generated by running the script in Google Earth Engine.
